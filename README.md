# Periodic Table Speller

Deployment:  https://irongade.github.io/algo-periodic-table/

This project explores the algorithmic complexities (speed and memory) of checking if an input word can be "spelled" (case-insensitive) by a sequence of the chemical symbol abbreviations from the standard periodic table.

For example, the word "accept" can be spelled with Ac (Actinium) + Ce (Cerium) + Pt (Platinum).

The goal of this tool is to check if an input word can be "spelled" with the periodic table symbols, and then to show that sequence of element symbols.
